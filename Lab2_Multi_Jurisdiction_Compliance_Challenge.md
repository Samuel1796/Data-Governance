## Customer A - Abena (Ghana DPA, Act 843)

**Does she have the right to deletion?**
Yes. Ghana's DPA requires data be held only as long as necessary (§17). Abena has no open orders and says she no longer shops online - ShopGhana has no reason to keep her data.

**What must ShopGhana do?**
- Delete her account, profile, browsing history, and marketing data
- Keep financial/transaction records for **6 years** (tax compliance)
- Notify any third parties (couriers, payment processors) to delete her data
- Send written confirmation when done

**Response deadline:** No exact number in the law - **21 days** is the accepted best practice.

**Draft Response:**
> *"Dear Abena, we've received your deletion request. Your account, profile, and marketing data will be deleted within 21 days. We are legally required to retain purchase transaction records for 6 years for tax purposes. These will not be used for any marketing. You'll receive confirmation once complete. - ShopGhana DPO"*

## Customer B - Lukas (GDPR, Article 17)

**Does he have the right to erasure?**
Yes - one of GDPR's strongest rights. His order is delivered, there's no dispute, and he's explicitly invoking Article 17. ShopGhana **must act**.

**Are there exemptions?**
Yes - one applies. German law (HGB §257 and AO §147) requires businesses to keep financial/tax records for **10 years**. ShopGhana cannot delete invoices or order records, but must delete everything else.

**What must ShopGhana do?**
- Delete his account, email, password, browsing history, marketing data, and analytics
- Archive only the invoice/tax records (no marketing use)
- Notify all third-party processors (delivery partner, email tool, payment processor) to erase his data under **Article 17(2)**
- Respond formally within 30 days confirming what was deleted and what was kept

**Response deadline:** **30 calendar days.** Can extend to 90 days for complex cases, but must tell Lukas within the first 30 days.

**What if they miss the deadline?**
- Lukas can complain to the Berlin data authority (BlnBDI)
- Fines up to **€20 million or 4% of global revenue** (whichever is higher)
- Lukas can also sue for compensation

**Draft Response:**
> *"Dear Lukas, we've verified your identity and are processing your GDPR Article 17 request. Your account, profile, marketing, and analytics data will be permanently deleted within 30 days. We are legally required to retain invoices and tax records for 10 years under German law - these will not be used for any other purpose. We have also instructed our delivery and payment partners to erase your data. You may complain to the BlnBDI if unsatisfied. - ShopGhana EU DPO"*

## Customer C - Maria (CCPA / CPRA)

**What rights does she have?**
- Right to **delete** her personal data
- Right to **opt out of the sale and sharing** of her data - she's invoked both

**Can ShopGhana delete everything immediately?**
No - not yet. She has an **active return dispute**. CCPA (§1798.105(d)) allows ShopGhana to hold data needed to resolve the dispute. Deleting it now could actually harm Maria's own return claim.

What ShopGhana *can* delete right now: marketing data, browsing history, analytics, preferences.
What must wait: her name, address, order details, and payment info - until the dispute is resolved.

**What about the "stop selling my data" request?**
This must be honoured **immediately - no exceptions, no delays.** Under CPRA, "selling" includes sharing data for advertising even if no money changes hands. ShopGhana must:
- Stop all third-party data sharing right now
- Notify ad partners and data brokers from the past 90 days
- Keep this opt-out active for **at least 12 months**

**Response deadline:** **45 calendar days** for deletion (extendable to 90). Opt-out: **immediate**.

**What must ShopGhana disclose to Maria?**
- What was deleted now and what's being held (and why)
- When full deletion will happen after the dispute closes
- Confirmation the opt-out is in effect
- That she can complain to the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA)
- That she won't be penalised for making this request

**Draft Response:**
> *"Dear Maria, we've processed your opt-out of data sale and sharing effective today - no third party will receive your data. For your deletion request: we've deleted your marketing, browsing, and analytics data immediately. We're holding your order and account data while your return dispute is active, as required by CCPA §1798.105(d). Once resolved, we'll delete the rest within 15 days. Tax records will be kept 4–7 years per legal requirement. You may contact the CPPA at cppa.ca.gov with any concerns. - ShopGhana Privacy Officer"*

## Key Takeaway for ShopGhana

Three requests, three different laws, three different deadlines - all received the same day. The biggest risks are:

- **Missing Lukas's 30-day GDPR deadline** : most severe financial penalty
- **Not honouring Maria's opt-out immediately** : no grace period exists
- **Deleting Maria's dispute data too early** : could invalidate her own return claim

ShopGhana needs a **centralised request tracking system** that flags the correct law, deadline, and required actions per customer - before the next batch of requests arrives.
